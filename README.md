# Python Arcade Collab

Python Arcade Collab is a group Pygame project focused on creating a collection of Atari-esqu mini-games.  Please note that this is a CC-0 project so all code contributions must be licensed as such.  Resources (images, music, fonts) without CC0 licenses are permitted, but they must have permissive licenses for non-commerical projects. Discussion on the project takes place on [our project subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PythonArcadeCollab/).

## Project Goals  

* A chance for people to get some experience working together on a project
* A chance to use github's collaborative abilities
* Something people of all experience levels can contribute to
* [CC-0 licensing](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0) for code to make using the project as a resource hassle-free
* Make decisions by consensus whenever possible

## How can I get involved?  

### Make a game:  
There are several games on the lobby screen which are place holders. Pick a game from among these (that hasn't already been chosen by someone else) or add a different game of your choosing. The focus is on simple arcade games, but really any type of game is fine if you want to put the work in.  To add a new game to the lobby copy the folder template into the games folder and rename it to the name of your game;  that's it.  
See the Adding a game section of the wiki for more info (to be constructed).

### Code review:  
If you're short on time, but long on experience, consider looking over the repo with an eye towards improvement. You can actually make changes and send a pull request, [post to the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/PythonArcadeCollab/) with your suggestion or contact [/u/mekire](http://www.reddit.com/user/mekire). Whatever is easiest for you. Keep in mind that your contributions must be CC-0.

### Testing:  
We are always looking for ways to improve any aspect of the project, so try it out and let us know what you think, good or bad. Especially bad. If you come across a bug (or even just out of date documentation), please try to include as much detail as possible, including the traceback if there is one. Also include your OS and Python version.
